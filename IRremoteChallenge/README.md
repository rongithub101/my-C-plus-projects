This is a cool project where you get to control everything via the IR remote! 

Main Features:
1) Power Toggle:
    - Turn the RGB LED on or off using the power button on the IR remote
2) Color Control: 
    - Use the IR remote to toggle between Red, Green and Blue
    - You can also adjust the brightness of the selected color
3) Color Animation:
    - A circle mode to continously change the LED colors until you want it to stop
4) Custom function:
    - Mini light show that changes colors and controls a servo motor for rotation! 
    
This is done using an Aurdino Mega, and complied via the Aurdino environment. I have attached the same Aurdino code file as a cpp file in case if you are not able to access it. Hope you enjoy!
